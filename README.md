Cancer Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains a pipeline for analyzing cancer and control patient datasets using next-generation sequencing data. The pipeline involves several functions that perform various tasks, from data preprocessing to neural network-based analysis. Please note that due to the intensive nature of the analysis, there might be cases where your computer's memory might not be sufficient to process all the data.

Function Descriptions
1. metadata_treat
This function utilizes data from the sraruntable metadata file, which can be obtained through the NCBI SRA Run Selector. It creates a dataset containing information about control and cancer patients, along with their SRA run names.

2. sra_script
Using the SRA run names from the dataset generated by metadata_treat, this function downloads SRA run data, aligns it to the human hg38 genome, and generates BED files. Replace "cancer" with "control" if using the df_control dataset.

3. test_on_script
This function conducts tests on the BED files to enable thorough analysis of the dataset. Various tests and quality checks are performed to ensure the reliability of the data.

4. chrom_info
Extracts chromosome positioning information from the BED files, which is essential for generating histograms containing fragment distribution data.

5. histogram_creation
Uses the chromosome positioning information to create histograms that provide insights into fragment distribution patterns within the dataset.

6. AI_simple_NN_WRST
Implements a small neural network using the histogram_creation data. This neural network aids in data analysis and treatment.

Important Notice
Please be aware that due to the complexity of the analysis and the large amount of data involved, your computer's memory might be insufficient to handle all aspects of this pipeline. It's recommended to have a system with sufficient memory and processing capabilities before attempting to run this analysis.
